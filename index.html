    <p class='description'>
        Rather surprisingly, the hydra is always defeated in a <em>finite</em> number of turns!  
        Even though the hydra seems to regrow nodes exponentially, the depth of the tree never actually increases.
        Eventually only the root node remains and the battle ends.

    <p class='rules'>
        <strong>Rules</strong> 
        The game starts at turn $t = 1$.<br>
        Each turn, until the hydra is defeated:
        <ol type='1'>
            <li>Choose a leaf node $V$.</li>
            <li>Delete $V$ from tree.</li>
            <li>Then, attach $t$ copies of the subtree rooted at $V$'s parent to $V$'s grandparent*.</li>
            <li>Increment $t$ by $1$.</li>
        </ol>

        <span style='padding-left: 20px;'>
            <em>*If the grandparent does not exist, do nothing.</em>
        </span>
        <br>
        <br>
        These rules guarantee termination. However, this cannot be proven in Peano Arithmetic as the proof requires transfinite induction.
